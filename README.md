# EFPRP TrueID Verification Flow
The EFPRP TrueID Verification Flow is a HTML based code that allows to compare the existing data with the user's input for easy ID Verification.

The European Fire Prevention & Rural Preservation Organization has developped a Verification service that allows everyone to verify a EFPRP ID. This service is open-source and free to use and can be found in the Official Github Page of the EFPRP.

We've implemented this service to fight against identity theft, impersonation and fraud. This service is free to use. Here are the instructions:

1. Access the EFPRP TrueID Verificationâ„¢ Flow website.
2. Scroll down to the ID Verification box.
3. Input the employee's or volunteer's ID*.

The HTML code/file comes with a test employee. His ID is 1.

To add more employees/volunteers you need to edit the code and add them manually.


*If the ID is valid, employee or volunteer information and details will show, else, the ID is not valid and therefore needs to be reported to our Support Team.
